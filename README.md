# hello-world

Hi. My name is Michael. I like to eat sushi as well as play ping-pong and soccer. I also like Ariana Grande.

I also like to play soccer. 

If you want it, take it,
I should've said it before.
Try to hide, fake it,
I can't pretend anymore.

I only wanna die alive,
Never by the hands of a broken heart,
I don't wanna hear you lie tonight,
Now that I've become who I really are.
